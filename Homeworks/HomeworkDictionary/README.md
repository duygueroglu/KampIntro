# HomeworkDictionary
It's a simple dictionary console app. 
  I added three words. In MyDictionary class, there's a searching with try-catch block. If there's a matching, the matching word is printing to screen with Program class. 
  If there's no matching, MyDictionary class send a message to screen like "The word doesn't exist".
